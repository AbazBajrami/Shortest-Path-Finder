# Shortest-Path-Finder
This is a system that helps you find the shortest path between 2 points

How to use:
1. Upload an image with a map (See images in repository. I use the map of Rome)
2. When you do this the system turns the image black and white. The road is turned white and everything else is turned black.
3. Press on one of the roads (this will make a red point on the map) and then press on another road
4. Then press find path. This will highlight the shortest path possible between these 2 paths. 
  (Bug: When you press find path, a path is highlight but the start and end points seem to be different. This shows us that the algorithm of finding
   the shortest path works but that there's an issue with the inputs of start and end points)
5. You can add landmarks by pressing on the road creating a red mark on the map and filling out the landmark name and cultural value of the landmark.
